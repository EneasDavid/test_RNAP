# Question 2 â€“ Deep Neural Network for Multivariable Regression

## Objective

Build a deep neural network to solve a multivariable regression problem with both **numerical and categorical input features**.

## Task Details

You will implement a regression model using a deep neural network with the following requirements:

- At least **4 hidden layers**.
- Accept **mixed data types**:
  - Numeric features should be standardized.
  - Categorical features must be properly encoded.
- Use adequate activations in hidden and output layers.
- Use adequate as the loss function.
- Return the adequate performance metric on test set.

## Files Provided

- `student_template.py`: Your implementation goes here.
- `test.py`: Contains code to test your implementation.

## Instructions

1. Implement the function `build_and_train_model(X_train, y_train, X_test)` in `student_template.py`.
2. Handle preprocessing of numeric and categorical data inside your function.
3. Train your model and return predictions for `X_test`.

## Requirements

- Use PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras (preferably Keras for simplicity).
- Do not use autoML libraries.
