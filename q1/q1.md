# Question 1 – Perceptron and Non-Linearly Separable Data

## Objective

You must implement a Perceptron algorithm and analyze its performance on a dataset that is **not linearly separable**. This task will help you understand the limitations of the original Perceptron model when dealing with such data.

## Instructions

1. **Do not use scikit-learn’s `Perceptron` class** or any pre-built classifier. Implement the algorithm from scratch using NumPy.
2. You are given synthetic data using `make_blobs`, modified to make the classes not linearly separable.
3. Your implementation should include:
   - Initialization of weights
   - Prediction
   - Training using the Perceptron learning rule
4. You should complete the function `train_perceptron(X, y, epochs, lr)` in `student_template.py`.

## Your Goal

- Complete the `train_perceptron()` function.
- Return the final weights after training.

## How to Test

Run the `test.py` file to validate your implementation. It will:
- Generate the non-linearly separable dataset
- Train your model
- Evaluate its performance and decision boundary
